Event Management
This project includes features such as the ability to create events that can be saved to a server. You can also edit and delete existing information. It has two profiles: administrator and user. Each has a different window with a different purpose. The administrator has the ability to create events, while the user can register for events created by the administrator.

The project is in development, so it has some imperfections.
